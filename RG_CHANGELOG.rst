RG Changelog
############

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on `Keep a Changelog <https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/>`_,
and this project adheres to customized Semantic Versioning e.g.: `palm-rg.1`

Footer synchronization with upstream occurs at the time of a major release, such as Palm, Quince, Redwood, etc. If there were no changes in our version of the footer between major releases, we simply add a note stating that a sync was performed with the specified upstream footer version. The synchronization process involves creating a new branch based on the latest upstream tag and transferring our changes there, either by cherry-picking or even manually.
